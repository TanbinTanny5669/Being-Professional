                <p>CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and
                    fonts. It
                    allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small
                    screens, or printers. CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language.
                    The
                    separation of HTML from CSS makes it easier to maintain sites, share style sheets across pages, and
                    tailor pages to different environments. This is referred to as the separation of structure (or:
                    content)
                    from presentation.</p>

                <p>WebFonts is a technology that enables people to use fonts on demand over the Web without requiring
                    installation in the operating system. W3C has experience in downloadable fonts through HTML, CSS2,
                    and
                    SVG. Until recently, downloadable fonts have not been common on the Web due to the lack of an
                    interoperable font format. The WebFonts effort plans to address that through the creation of an
                    industry-supported, open font format for the Web (called "WOFF")</p>
